## Lesson 5. Where to Go From Here

Our tutorial is now complete, but your journey with NativeScript is just beginning! Let’s look at the some steps you can take to build your next app with NativeScript.

### Step 1. Download NativeScript Sidekick or the NativeScript CLI

NativeScript Playground is great for tinkering with NativeScript apps, but now that you’ve learned the NativeScript basics, you’re ready to set up a professional development environment to build your next app. Here are two options for your next step.

* **Option 1: [Download NativeScript Sidekick](https://www.nativescript.org/nativescript-sidekick)**: NativeScript Sidekick is a desktop development tool for building NativeScript apps. Sidekick offers starter templates to help you get started, and tooling for tying into more advanced NativeScript functionality, such as plugins, builds, and debugging workflows.

* **Option 2: [Install the NativeScript CLI](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/tutorial/ng-chapter-1)**: If you’re comfortable working with a command-line interface, you can install and work with the NativeScript CLI. The NativeScript CLI lets you build full iOS and Android apps locally on your development machine.

Once you’re set up to build your next app, there are a few other steps you may want to take to be successful building with NativeScript.

### Step 2. Join the NativeScript community

Regardless of what you choose to do next with NativeScript, joining the NativeScript community is a great way to keep up with the latest and greatest in the NativeScript world. Here are some ways you can get involved:

- **Follow [@NativeScript](https://twitter.com/nativescript) on Twitter** for updates on all things NativeScript.
- **Sign up for the [NativeScript newsletter](https://www.nativescript.org/nativescript-newsletter)**. The newsletter will deliver NativeScript articles, news, plugin updates, and more straight to your inbox.
- **Join the [NativeScript Community Slack](http://developer.telerik.com/wp-login.php?action=slack-invitation)**. The community Slack is a great place to chat with others in the NativeScript community.
- **Sign up for the NativeScript Community Forum

### Step 3. Bookmark NativeScript learning resources

There are a variety of NativeScript learning materials that go above and beyond what was offered in this tutorial. You may wish to refer to any of the following as you take your app from a prototype to the app stores:

- The NativeScript team provides a series of [real-world app samples](https://www.nativescript.org/app-samples-with-code) that are all open source on GitHub. These samples are great to reference as you’re developing your application.
- The [NativeScript code samples reference](http://docs.nativescript.org/angular/code-samples/overview) contains a number of copy and paste friendly examples for building your user interface.
- The [NativeScript resources page](https://www.nativescript.org/resources) lists further NativeScript learning material, such as training, books, and screencasts.
- [NativeScript Snacks](http://www.nativescriptsnacks.com/) is a collection of bite-sized video tutorials—perfect for learning how a NativeScript concept works quickly.
- The NativeScript documentation site has detailed guides on topics that were out of scope for this guide, including [unit testing](http://docs.nativescript.org/core-concepts/testing), [debugging](http://docs.nativescript.org/core-concepts/debugging), [transpiling Babel or TypeScript code](http://docs.nativescript.org/core-concepts/transpilers), and [publishing to the iOS App Store](http://docs.nativescript.org/core-concepts/publishing-ios-apps) and [Google Play](http://docs.nativescript.org/core-concepts/publishing-android-apps).
- The third-party site [NativeScripting](https://nativescripting.com/) has a series of high-quality free and premium videos that cover a variety of NativeScript topics.
