Welcome to the NativeScript & Angular getting started guide. In this hands-on tutorial, you‚Äôll build a cross-platform iOS and Android app from scratch.

In this first lesson, you‚Äôll learn what NativeScript is, how to use the Playground environment, and what you‚Äôll be building in this tutorial.

> **TIP**: If you run into problems during this tutorial, the [NativeScript community forum](https://discourse.nativescript.org/) is a great place to reach out for help.

### Step 1. Get your first app up and running

The environment you‚Äôre in right now is called NativeScript Playground. NativeScript Playground.

NativeScript Playground is a browser-based environment for developing simple NativeScript apps. It‚Äôs a great place to get started learning NativeScript, as you can develop apps without needing to install the various SDKs and tools needed for native iOS and Android development‚Äîfor now all you need is an Android or iOS device.

> **NOTE**: At the end of this tutorial you‚Äôll learn about the tools you‚Äôll want to use for professional application development, such as [NativeScript Sidekick](https://www.nativescript.org/nativescript-sidekick) and the [NativeScript command-line interface](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli).

Let‚Äôs see how NativeScript Playground works in action.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a.** Get out at an Android or iOS device. You need at least one device to complete this tutorial.

* **b.** Download and install the **NativeScript Playground** app on your device by either searching for ‚ÄúNativeScript Playground‚Äù in the iOS App Store or Google Play, or by using the links below.

* **c.** Download and install the **NativeScript Preview** app on your device by either searching for ‚ÄúNativeScript Preview‚Äù in the iOS App Store or Google Play, or by using the links below.

* **d.** Open the **NativeScript Playground** app on your device(s), and click the **Scan QR code** action.

* **e.** In your web browser, click the **QR Code** button at the top of the Playground interface.

* **f.** Scan the QR code in your browser with your device; you should see a simple ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù app on your device.

> **INTERNAL TODO**: We need a way of making screenshots like this look good in the Playground interface.

> **NOTE**: Groceries is the name of the app you‚Äôll be building in this tutorial.

<hr data-action="end" />

And with that, you‚Äôre running your first NativeScript app on your device! Now that you have your app up and running, let‚Äôs start tinkering.

### Step 2. Establishing a development workflow

NativeScript lets you develop native iOS and Andorid apps using JavaScript. One of the advantages of this approach is that NativeScript can update your apps fast, as NativeScript doesn‚Äôt have to run bytecode builds everytime a file changes.

Let‚Äôs see this in action by making a few updates.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a.** Open your app‚Äôs `app/app.component.ts` file, and replace its contents with the code below, which updates the label‚Äôs text.

``` TypeScript
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "my-app",
  template: "<Label text='hello NativeScript'></Label>"
})
export class AppComponent {}
```

* **b**. Save the change by typing `Ctrl` + `S` on Windows or `Cmd` + `S` on macOS. You should your app on your device automatically update.

> **TIP** You can develop on multiple devices simultaneously. If you have multiple iOS or Android devices, download the **NativeScript Playground** app on each and scan this app‚Äôs QR code.

<hr data-action="end" />

One of the biggest benefits of using NativeScript is the fast development workflow you just saw in action. You have the ability to change your code and see those changes instantly‚Äîeven on multiple devices.

In NativeScript you use native iOS and Android user interface components to build your app; NativeScript does not use a WebView or web browser in any way. This isn‚Äôt obvious when using a simple `<Label>`, so let‚Äôs make one more change so you can get a sense of just what NativeScript makes possible.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a**. Open your `app/app.component.ts` file and replace its contents with the following code, which shows a chart.

> **NOTE:** Don‚Äôt worry about exactly what this code is doing at the moment. You‚Äôll learn about how Angular and NativeScript work in the next lesson.

> **INTERNAL TODO:** Can we come up with a fun example we could use here to show off the charts?

``` TypeScript
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "my-app",
  template: `
<GridLayout>
  <RadCartesianChart>
      <CategoricalAxis tkCartesianHorizontalAxis></CategoricalAxis>
      <LinearAxis tkCartesianVerticalAxis></LinearAxis>
      <BarSeries tkCartesianSeries [items]="favoriteFruits" categoryProperty="type" valueProperty="count"></BarSeries>
  </RadCartesianChart>
</GridLayout>
`
})
export class AppComponent {
  favoriteFruits = [
    { type: "üçé", count: 7 },
    { type: "üçå", count: 15 },
    { type: "üçç", count: 12 },
    { type: "üçí", count: 30 },
    { type: "üçá", count: 16 }
  ]
}
```

* **b.** Save your `app/app.component.ts` file. You should see the following charts on your device.

![](images/android-3.png)

<hr data-action="end" />

You now have an app using completely native iOS and Android charts in a handful of lines of code. Cool, right?

Now that you have some background on how NativeScript Playground works, in the next lesson you‚Äôll learn about NativeScript and Angular by building a complete app from scratch.

> **TIP:** Take a minute to note the **Errors** section at the bottom of the NativeScript Playground screen. If you hit any errors during this tutorial you‚Äôll see them in this pane.
