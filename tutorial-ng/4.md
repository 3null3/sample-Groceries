## Lesson 4. Building Polished User Interfaces

In this chapter you'll learn about NativeScript modules, which are a series of TypeScript modules you use to add powerful functionality to your apps. Whether you've realized it or not, you've already used several NativeScript modules in this tutorial, as all of the NativeScript UI components are implemented with TypeScript code.

Let’s look at how you can use the NativeScript modules to improve your app, and we’ll start by taking a closer look at what you can do with NativeScript’s UI components.

#### Background: How the NativeScript modules are built

The source code for the NativeScript modules lives on GitHub in the [NativeScript/NativeScript repo](https://github.com/nativescript/nativescript). The modules are [distributed through npm as a “tns-core-modules” package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tns-core-modules), which all NativeScript apps depend on. Because the NativeScript modules are open source, you are welcome to [contribute changes](https://www.nativescript.org/contribute).

### Step 1. Customizing UI components

So far, you’ve only used NativeScript UI elements by including them in an Angular component’s `template`, but you can also programmaticly create and access UI elements, and each UI component has a set of properties and methods you can use to customize your app.

Before we start the next example, there’s one piece of background knowledge you need to know. In NativeScript, a single `<Page>` UI element wraps the `template` of every page-level Angular component. You don’t see this component, but it’s there, and it’s a UI component you can customize. Let’s look at how to do that.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a.** Open your `app/login/login.component.ts` file, and add the following import to the top, which adds a reference to the `Page` class from the NativeScript core modules.

``` TypeScript
import { Page } from "tns-core-modules/ui/page";
```

* **b.** Next, alter the same file’s existing `"@angular/core"` import to include the `OnInit` interface.

``` TypeScript
import { Component, OnInit } from "@angular/core";
```

* **c.** `OnInit` is a [TypeScript class interface](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html#class-types). To see how it works, make the following change to the declaration of your `LoginComponent` class.

``` TypeScript
export class LoginComponent implements OnInit {
```

After you add the new `implements` keyword, you should see an error in Playground that says something like *“Class ‘LoginComponent’ incorrectly implements interface ‘OnInit’”*. When you implement a TypeScript class interface, you’re telling the TypeScript compiler that you must implement all methods that the interface requires. In the case of `OnInit`, Angular requires you to implement a single `ngOnInit()` method.

* **d.** To implement it, add the following method to your `LoginComponent` class.

``` TypeScript
ngOnInit() {
  this.page.actionBarHidden = true;
}
```

> **NOTE**: `ngOnInit` is one of several [component lifecycle hooks](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/lifecycle-hooks.html) that Angular provides. As its name implies, `ngOnInit` gets invoked when Angular initializes this component.

* **e.** We’ll discuss what the code within `ngOnInit()` does momentarily, but finally, to make these changes compile and run, change the `LoginComponent`’s existing `constructor()` declaration to use the code below.

``` TypeScript
constructor(private router: Router, private userService: UserService, private page: Page) {
```

* **f.** Save your files. When your app refreshes the `<ActionBar>` should now be hidden on Android.
